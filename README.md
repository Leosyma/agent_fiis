## üß† How It Works

### Crew Orchestration

- **File:** `crew.py`
- Defines the core logic using CrewAI.
- Loads the YAML configuration of agents and tasks.
- Executes a `kickoff()` method to start reasoning and generate a response.

### Backend Execution

- **File:** `main.py`
- Contains the `run_fiis_assistant()` function.
- Initializes the crew and routes the input question to CrewAI logic.

### Streamlit Frontend

- **File:** `app.py`
- Provides an interactive UI.
- Allows the user to input a question.
- Displays the AI-generated recommendation or insight.
